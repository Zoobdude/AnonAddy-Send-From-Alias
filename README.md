A little gui to quickly send from an AnonAddy alias, made entirely in python using the [Flet](https://flet.dev) library.

Not my finest piece of code I will be honest. It was made as both a way of having a go with flet and to actually solve a task I have.

## First time setup

If you have not opened the app before you will be welcomed with a first time setup
This will ask for you API key, ask you to pick how you wish your aliases to be sorted and ask if you want to pick a default alias
This config will then be saved in a .ini file in the same folder as the exe

## My Setup

In my setup I have the exe located in a folder in my user profile
I put this in a folder so that the config file is stored with it

Then by right clicking on my desktop I create a new shortcut to the exe in documents
Then right clicking on the shortcut I set a keyboard shortcut:

I used CTRL + SHIFT + A

Now the app can be run through the shortcut. 

If you copy the email address you are sending to, to the clipboard before you open the app (run the shortcut) it will automaticalay use it
